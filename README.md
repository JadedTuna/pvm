pvm
===

pvm is a small virtual machine written in C.

Overview
========
Folder `src` contains source files for virtual machine (pvm.c) and the assembler (pasm.c).<br>
Folder `examples` contains some example assembly programs.

Docs and a tutorial can be found on my website: http://victorkindhart.com/projects/pvm/index.php

If you find any bugs - please report them as an issue on GitHub. Note that this project is still alpha - it probably has a lot of bugs (I have to fix memory management in pasm, error checking, etc).
